# Disassembly

- an act of reverse-engineering when you take an executable and create a human readable language using some assembler language
- often used in debudding compiled lanauge code like C++
- in VS (not VSC), there is a built in function to open a disassembler window
- requires some basic knowledge of that assembly language
- note that disassembly language will probably be different from source code because source code -> compiled -> assembled steps are already changing a ton of stuff

# Assembly language

- machine readable code that is based on bytes (8 bits) represented by a hexdecimal
