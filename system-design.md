# System(s) Design

Big picture ideas with no code.
Frequent interview questions.

Can be broken down to 3 things

1. scoping
2. sketching
3. identifying bottlenecks

## Scoping the problem

Ask questions to understand the contraints and use cases

## Sketching up an abstract design

illustrate the building blocks of the system and the relationships between them

## Identifying and addressing the bottlenecks

apply fundamental principles of scalable system design
