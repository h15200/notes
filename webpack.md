# Wepack

- used to separate components into file while organizing the entire project. Multiple components should not live in one file for scalability.

This is more high level than using babel alone - see babel.md
but more low-level than create-react-app.

## Setup

Structure

/src

/public
index.html
add `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="index.css>`
and right outside body `<script src="bundle.js"></script>`
if using react, make a div with id root inside body.
index.css
bundle.js will be auto generated by webpack, so do not make

`npm init -y`
`npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`

make and fill out webpack.config.js

```
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: './src/index.js', // the starting point for our program
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/public', // the absolute path for the directory where we want the output to be placed
    filename: 'bundle.js' // the name of the file that will contain our output - we could name this whatever we want, but bundle.js is typical
  }
}
```

make a script inside package.json for
"build" : "webpack -w"
