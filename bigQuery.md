# BigQuery

enterprise data warehouse that enables fast SQL queries using Google's infrastructure.
can be accessed by Cloud Console or `bq` command-line tool or using BigQuery REST API.

bigQuery has its own functions that can be used inside looker

## types

bigQuery has more types than sql (i think?)

for example there are 4 types of numbers

INT / INT will result in a float, so use functions like DIV(a, b) which will make an INT result
