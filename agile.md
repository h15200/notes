### Team

Product Owner - Defines priorities and has final sign-off on completed features
Scrum Master - Manages the Scrum board, assigns tasks, runs the standups
Dev Team - Everybody else who works on assigned tasks. Provides feedback

### Process

Stories - requirements that must be met
Todos - Split up into a number of smaller tasks
Process - Where in the todo process
Verify - testing
Done - completed task

### Standups

Daily 15 min review of current sprint

1. What did you do yesterday to work toward your sprint goals?
2. What will you do today?
3. Are you encountering any roadblocks?

Usually done once a day, but more IF it is efficient.
