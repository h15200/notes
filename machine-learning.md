# Python and Machine Learning

What is Machine eLearning?

- science of getting computers to act in desirable ways without being explicitly programmed using pattern recognition.

- based on existing data, computers learn how to predict results in the future on unseen data.

- a form of metaprogramming

In classical programming, we feed RULEDS and DATA and the program outputs ANSWERS

In machine learning, we feed DATA and ANSWERS and the program ouputs RULES.

## Majority of machine learning problems fall into 4 patterns

1. Regression: Can our data predict a number?
2. Classification: Can our data predict a category?
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Can our data be combined into a simpler format?
4. Clustering: Can we find natural grouping in our data?

Picking the approach is often MORE important than picking the right algorithm, because there is little theoretical guidance on picking an algorithm and there is no best algo for all types of data.

## Numpy

Python library for fast computaions with arrays
Particularly strong at computation with multi-dimensional arrays
We frequently refer to a one-dimensional array as a vector and a 2-d array a matrix
