# Typescript

Use type systems to catch errors. Used during development only.

Type annotations are added in js to analyze code.

Typescript transpiles (compiling is going from human code to machine code) to regular js. It provides no performance optimization like C.

# Setup

To install typescript, `npm i -g typescript ts-node`
To see if you already have it, `tsc -v` which stands for typescrip compiler
