# Docker

Server computers used to host one app, which often did not utilizie the full capacticy of the machine.

Virtual machines were developed to have multiple apps with multiple OS's, controlled by the Hypervisor.

Then containers were developed to do the same thing that virtual machines did but on only ONE OS (linux) to pacakge multiple apps.

Containers are MUCH faster and more light-weight than virtual machines, making them highly scalable and portable.

Virtual machines - multiple houses
containers - multiple apartment units
